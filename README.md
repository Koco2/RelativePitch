# RelativePitch

Relative is an educational game. Players can train their ear and improve their ability to recognize different music pitches. In the beginning, users will need to play the basic mode (level mode) in order to increase familiarity with different pitches  and unlock songs


It is fascinating when users discover that they can play songs without any assistance!
